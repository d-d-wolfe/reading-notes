**Lists, Tables, Forms, and Events**

**Forms in HTML**
- Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a vorm, which lives inside a <form> element.

- information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

- each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.

- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.

**Lists, Tables & Forms in CSS**

- There are several CSS properties that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

- List markers can be given different appearances using the *list-style-type* and *list-style* image properties.

- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.

- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are fertically aligned using CSS.

- Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.

**Events**

- Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (like when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked).

- Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element your are waiting for that event to happen on.

- When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.

- You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.

- The most commonly used events are the W3C DOM events, although there are others in the HTML5 specification as well as browser-specific events.
