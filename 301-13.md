**Sending Form Data**

- The *form* element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button.

- The two most important attributes are *action* and *method*.

  - The *action* attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL.

  - The *method* attribute defines how data is sent. HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the *GET* and *POST* methods.
    
    - The *GET* method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource.

    - The *POST* method is the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request.
