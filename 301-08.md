**SQL**

- SQL is Structured Query Language. It's a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users to query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.

- A relational database represents a collection of related tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns and any number of rows.

- To retreive data from a SQL database, we need to write **SELECT** statements, which are refered to as queries.

- We can think of a table in SQL as a type of entity, and each row in that table as a specific instance of that type.

- The colums whould then represent the common properties shared by all instance of that entity.

- In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a **WHERE** clause in the query. This clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.

- More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous **AND** or **OR** logical keywords.

- We can use the **ORDER BY** clause to sort our results by column.
