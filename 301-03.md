**Flexbox and Templating**

**Flexbox**

- Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things, including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (flex items). I've detailed some of the more common properties below.

*Container Properties*

- display - defined a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex content for all its direct children

- flex-direction - Establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.

- flex-wrap - By default, flex items will all try to fit on one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.

- flex-flow - This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.

- justify-content - This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space left over.

*Item Properties*

- order - By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the *order* property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.

- flex - This is shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. It's recommended that you use this shorthand property rather than set the individual properties.





**JavaScript Templating**

- Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with JavaScript by using a JSON data source.

- The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

- The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and converts the template int an HTML file sent to the client.

**Mustache**

- *Mustache* is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code, etc. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

- mustache.js is an implementation of the Mustache template system in JavaScript. It's often considered the base for JavaScript templating.

- Mustache is not a templating engine. It is a *specification* for a templating language.

- If you intend to use Mustache with Node and Express, you can use *mustache-express*.
