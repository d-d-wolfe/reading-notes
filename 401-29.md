## Component Composition

**Routing**

- Using `react-router`, you can easily toggle the visibility of componenets (or even pages) based on the URL/Route that the user engages with.

- `import {Route} from 'react-router-dom';`

- To use Browser Router properly, you eliminate your use of `<a>` tags and instead use its built-in `<Link>` component.

```
<Link to="/">Home</Link>
<Link to="/stuff">Stuff</Link>
```

- In practice, then, use the router componenet to look at either `/` or `/stuff` and based on that, displaying either the `Home` or the `List` component, like this:

```
 <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
 <Route exact path="/stuff" render={() => <List>{items}</List>} />
```

**Component Composition**

- In this setup, you are sending your child components the raw data and allowing them to render the output as they decide.

```
// Dashboard Wrapper
//  - feeds the SearchForm some methods
//  - then feeds the results some data

<Dashboard>
  <SearchForm handler={this.doTheSearch} />
  <Results data={this.state.results} />
</Dashboard>

// .. Results Component
<ul>
  {this.props.data.map( (item,i) => <li key={i}>{item}</li> );
</ul>

```

**Component Composition - Using Logic-less Children**

- This is typically used when your `children` are already in JSX format (pre-rendered) and you need to display them as a whole. A good example might be a gallery of images:

```
<Dashboard>
  render() {
    let listings = {this.state.results.map( (item,i) => <li key={i}>{item}</li> );
  }
  <SearchForm handler={this.doTheSearch} />
  <Results>
    { listings.map( listing => listing ) }
  </Results>
</Dashboard>

// Results Component

<ul>
  {this.props.children}
</ul>
```
