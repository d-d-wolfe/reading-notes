**Local Storage for Web Applications**

- What is HTML5 Storage? 

  - It's a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser.

  - Similiar to cookies, this data persists even after navigating away from the website, closing the browser tab, exiting the browser, etc.

  - Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless someone does so manually).

- You can access HTML5 Storage through the *localStorage* object on the global *window* object.
