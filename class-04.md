**HTML Links and Layouts, JS Functions, and 6 Reasons for Pair Programming**

**Links**

- Create a link using the <a> element.

- The <a> element uses href to denote the page you are linking to.

- When linking to a page within your own site, use relative links rather than full URLs.

- You can create a link that will open an email program with an email address in the "to" field.

Use the id attribute to target elements within a page that is being linked to.

**Layout**

- Building Blocks - CSS treats every HTML element as if it is inside its own box. This box can either be a *block-level* box or an *inline* box.

- Containing Elements - If one block-level element sits inside another one, the outer box is known as the *containing* or *parent* element.

- Positioning Schemes - Normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the *position* property in CSS (you can also *float* elements).

- Box Offset - You can use this to tell the browser how far from the top/bottom or left/right a box should be. 

**Functions**

- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a task. You can reuse a function, if you need to perform the same task in a different part of the script, by calling the function again, rather than rewriting the entire series of code.

- Declaring a function - Give the function a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.

-  Calling a function - Now that you've declared the function, you can *call* the function, and execute all of the statements in it, with one line of code, similar to this: functionName();

Declaring functions that need information - Some functions need specific information to perform the task they are assigned. In these cases, when you declare the function you have to give it parameters. These parameters act like variables, within the function. 

Calling functions that need information - To call a function that has parameters, you have to specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. These values are called arguments, and can be either static values or variables.

- Getting a single value from a function - Some functions return information to the code that called them, like when they perform a calculation, they will return the result of the calculation.

- Getting multiple values from a function - Functions can return more than one value using an array.

**6 Reasons for Pair Programming**

- Pair Programming utilizes two developers, working together (colaborating), to write meaningful code.

  - There are four fundamental skills used in learning a new language (like coding languages):

    - Listening - hearing and interpreting the vocabulary.

    - Speaking - using the correct words to communicate an idea.

    - Reading - understanding what is conveyed in writing.

    - Writing - producing from scratch a meaningful block of code.
  
- The 6 reasons are:

  - Greater efficiency - Although, in the short run, it may take a little longer, pair programming produces higher quality code that usually doesn't require extra effort, at a later time, to troubleshoot and debug.

  - Engaged collaboration - When developers pair program, they rely on each other and usuall can find a solution together without asking for additional help. This can boost confidence.

  - Learning from fellow students - Working with a teammate can expose developers to ideas that they wouldn't have though of on their own. 

  - Social skills - When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can help us improve interpersonal skills, which in turn helps us in the workplace.

  - Job interview readiness - A common interview process includes pair programming with a current employee. By doing this a company can get a better feel for how you will fit into the team.

  - Work environment readiness - Knowing how to pair program helps the new employee hit the ground running, rather than having to be trained in this technique.
