**Diversity and Inclusion**

- As someone who has been a victim of age discrimination (although I wasn't able to prove it), I am extremely conscious of diversity and inclusion.

- The numbers of enrollments among men and women in computer science were on their way toward parity in the 1970s and early 1980s. In 1984, 37% of computer science graduates were women.

- In the tech industry, discrimination against women comes from the early days of personal computers (mid 1980s) when most, if not all, the advertising for computers was directed toward men and boys.

- As a result of this, in 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter were male.

- In technical roles, this phenomenon is even more pronounced; for example, only 10% of the technical workforce at Twitter is female.

- Even when women do have considerable experience with coding and mathematics, the male-dominated environment that has arisen becomes an obstacle to entry for many.

- The few women who do make it into the field are far less likely to stay than their male counterparts. The Center for Talent Innovation, a research think tank, found that US women are 45% more likely than men to leave careers in technology.

- Though there are isolated examples of both vintage and contemporary computer advertising aimed at women, it is clear that the advertising narrative around women and technology needs to be more inclusive if the gender gap is going to close.

- As the push for diversity in tech continues, a growing number of companies and leaders are confronting the topic for the first time.

- Diversity efforts are most successful when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

- Study after study in fields like organizational science, psychology and education indicate that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation.

- Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.

- Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent.

- When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.

- For company leaders beginning to consider diversity and inclusion, understanding these rationales and identifying one that resonates for you and your organization can be a helpful first step.
