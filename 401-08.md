## Express Routing & Connected API

- Routes can be managed in separate module from the main server, allowing us to extract that logic and wiring to be more topical.

- How does this change the server's role?

  - index.js - Entry Point

  - server.js - Hub, Exported Server

  - models/categories.js - Data Models

  - routes/categories.js, etc. - Rutes and Handlers
