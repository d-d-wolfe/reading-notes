**HTML *canvas* Element & Chart.js**

**Basic Usage of canvas**

- At first sight, the *canvas* element looks like the *img* element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the *src* and *alt* attributes.

- The *canvas* element can be styled just like any normal image.

- It differes from an *img* tag in that it is easy to define some fallback content.

- As a consequence of the way fallback is provided, it requires a closing tag.

- It is initially blank. to display something, a script first needs to access the rendering context and draw on it.

**Chart.js**

- You can download *Chart.js* from GitHub Releases.

- It's easy to get started with Chart.js. All that's required is the script included in your page with a single *canvas* node to render the chart.
