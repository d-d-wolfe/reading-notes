**jQuery**

- jQuery is a JavaScript file that you include in your web pages. It lets you find elements using CSS-style selectors and then do something with the elements using jQuery methods.

- jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more," because it allows you to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code than you would need to write with plain JavaScript.

- When you select one or more elements, a jQuery object is returned. It's also known as a *matched set* or a *jQuery selection*.

- Some jQuery methods both retrieve information from, and update the contents of, elements. But they don't always apply to all elements.

- When you create a selection with jQuery, it stores a reference to the corresponding nodes in the DOM tree. It doesn't create copies of them.

- A jQuery object stores references to elements. Caching a jQuery object stores a reference to it in a variable.

- jQuery's .ready() method checks that the page is ready for your code to work with. 

- You can use a version of jQuery that is hosted by other companies, by loading from a CDN. However you should still include a fallback version.

**Pair Programming**

- *Pair Programming* is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.

- Pair programming commonly involves two roles:
  
  - The Driver - Handling the "mechanics" of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and writing code.
  
  - The Navigator - Uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.

- 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

  1. Greater efficiency - When two people focus on the same code base, it's easier to catch mistakes in the making. It may take a little longer, but it produces higher-quality code that doesn't require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging.

  2. Engaged collaboration - When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.

  3. Learning from fellow students - Often, the developers in a pairing have different skill sets. If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area.

  4. Social skills - Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key.

  5. Job interview readiness - For most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as important to a company than specific technical skills.

  6. Work environment readiness - Many companies that utilize pair programming expect to train fresh hires on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Being already familiar with it lets us hit the ground running.
