**Database Normalization**

- Database Normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The main idea is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics.

- There are three main reasons to normalize a database:

  - Minimize duplicate data.

  - Minimize or avoid data modification issues.

  - To simplify queries.

- Data duplication presents two problems:
  
  - It increases storage and decreases performance

  - It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes

- Modification anomalies:

  - Insert Anomaly - There are facts we can't record until we know information for the entire row.

  - Update anomaly - If we don't update all rows, then inconsistencies appear.

  - Deletion anomaly - Deleting a row causes removal of more than one set of facts.

- Search and sort issues - If you want to search for data, but it's not normalized, it can cause issues, especially if you want to search *and* sort, when the information isn't normalized.

- There are three common forms of database normalization: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form (AKA 1NF, 2NF, AND 3NF).

  - 1NF - The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.

  - 2NF - The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table's primary key.

  - 3NF - The table is in second normal form and all of its columns ar not transitively dependent on the primary key.
