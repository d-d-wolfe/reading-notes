**CSS Layout**

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

- The *float* property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-columnlayouts (You must define a width for a floated item.)

- Pages can be fixed width or liquid layouts.

- Designers usually keep pages within 900-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to show its relevance without scrolling).

- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
