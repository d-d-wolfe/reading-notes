**EJS Partials**

- Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views (like a nav bar or footer).

- Create a <partials> folder in the <views> folder. Then create a file for the partial (ex: navbar.ejs). This file will only contain the HTML for the nav bar.

- Here is a sample:  <!-- views/partials/navbar.ejs -->
  <!--  <div class="header clearfix">
        <nav>
            <ul class="nav nav-pills pull-right">
                <li role="presentation"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-muted">Node.js Blog</h3>
        </nav>
    </div> -->

- Once you have your partials defined, you can use them in your other ejs files (i.e.: home.ejs, post.ejs, etc.).

- To include a partial in an ejs file is quite easy. You use <%- include (PARTIAL_FILE) %> where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.
