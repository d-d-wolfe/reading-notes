**The Call Stack**

- A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions - what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

- A call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation.

- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.

- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.

- When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.

- If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.
