**HTML Images; CSS Color & Text**

- Images

  - The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.

  - You always have to specify a *src* attribute to indicate where the image is located (a source) and an *alt* attribute to describe the content of the image.

  - It's best to save your images at the size you will be using them on the webpage and in the correct format.

  - JPEGs are best for photos; GIFs are usually illustrations or logos that use flat colors.

- Color

  - Color brings a site to life, and helps convey the mood and may evoke reactions.

  - There are three ways to specify colors in CSS; RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

  - A color picker can help you choose the colors you want.

  - Make sure there is good contrast between text and background or people will not be able to read the content.

  - CSS3 has added another value for RGB colors, to indicate opacity, known as RGBA.

  - In CSS3 you can also specify colors as HSL (hue, saturation, and lightness) values, with an optional opacity value, known as HSLA.

- Text

  - There are properties to control font, size, weight, style and spacing of the text.

  - There is a limited number of fonts that most people have installed.

  - If you want to use a wider range of typefaces, there are options, however you need to have the correct licenses to use them.

  - You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned left, right, center, justified, or indented.

  - Pseudo-classes can be used to change the style of an element when someone hovers over or clicks on text, or when they've visited a link.
