**Functional Programming Concepts**

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of mathmatical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

- Pure functions return the same result if given the same arguments (also referred to as deterministic), and they don't cause any observable side effects.

- Immutability - Unchanging over time or unable to be changed. - When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it's created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can't. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

- Referential transparency - If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent. (pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency)

- *Filter* - The filter function expects a 'true' or 'false' value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result. If the callback expression is true, the filter function will include the element in the result, otherwise it will not.

- *Map* - the 'map' method transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values.

- *Reduce* - The idea of 'reduce' is to receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.
