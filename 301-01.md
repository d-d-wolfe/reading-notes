**SMACSS and Responsive Web Design**

**Responsive Web Design**

- With the growth in mobile Internet usage comes the question of how to build websites suitable for all users. The industry response to this question has become responsive web design, also known as *RWD*.

- RWD is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

- **Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile**

- Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change.

- Adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change.

- Mobile generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users.

- Currently, the most popular technique lies within responsive web design, favoring design that dynamically adapts to different browser and device viewports, changing layout and content along the way.

**Flexible Layouts**

- Flexible layouts is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width.

- Flexible layouts do not advocate the use of fixed measurement units, such as pixels or inches, because the viewport height and width continually change from device to device.

- When the layout gets too small, or too large, text may become illegible and the layout may begin to break. In this event, media queries can be used to help build a better experience.

**Media Queries**

- Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances.

**Initializing Media Queries**

- There a couple of different ways to use media queries:

  - Using the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet (this is generally recommended)

  - Importing a new style sheet using the @import rule

  - Linking to a separate style sheet from within the HTML document.

- Each media query may include a media type followed by one or more expressions.

- Common media types include *all*, *screen*, *print*, *tv*, and *braille*.

- If a media type is not specified the media query will default to *screen*.

**Logical Operators in Media Queries**

- There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries:

  - *and* - Using this logical operator allows an extra condition to be added

  - *not* - This logical operator negates the query, specifying any query but the one identified.

  - *only* - This is a new logical operaotr and is not recognized by user agents using HTML4, this hiding the styles from devices/browsers that don't support media queries.

**Media Features**

- *Height* and *Width* are the most common media features. You can also preface them with *min-* or *max-*

- *Orientation* - Determines if the device is in landscape (display is wider than taller) or portrait (display is taller than wider) orientation. 

- *Aspect-ratio* - Specifies the width/height pixel ratio of the targeted rendering area or output device.

- *Resolution* - Specifies the resolution of the output device in pixel density (DPI).

- *Other Media Features* - *color*, *color-index*, and *monochrome*, as well as *grid*, and *scan*.

**Mobile First**

- The mobile first approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default style for a website, then using media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.

- A user on a mobile device shouldn't have to load the styles for a desktop computer only to have them overwritten with mobile styles later, thus saving bandwidth/data.

- Additionally, downloading unnecessary media assets can be stopped using media queries. 

**Viewport**

- Sometimes, mobile devices can use a little assistance displaying websites using the *viewport* meta tag, which Apple invented.

- Using this keword with *device-height* and *device-width* will inherit the device's default height and width values.

- to control how a website is scaled on a mobile device, and how users can continue to scale a website, use the *minimum-scale*, *maximum-scale8, *initial-scale*, and *user-scalable* properties.

- You can also use *target-densitydpi* to give more control, specifically over the resolution of a device. Using this is rare.

- You can combine *viewport* values by separating them with a comma, within the *content* attribute value.

**Flexible Media**

- Finally, as viewports begin to change size, media doesn't always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.

- Using the *max-width* property with a value of 100% ensure that as the viewport gets smaller, any media will scale down according to its container's width.

- Embedded media (such as iframes) has special use cases and should be researched before using.
