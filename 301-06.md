**Node.js**

- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chorme's V8 JavaScript engine.

- The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Goodle Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers.

- The creator of Node.js (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, and HTTP library, and a number of operating system-related utility methods.

- Node.js has excellent support for ES6 and beyond. Which means that you don't generally have to worry about compatibility issues, like you would if you were writing JavaScript that would run in different browsers.
