**REST**

- What I got from this reading is that HTTP is a universal web protocol that allows computers to find information that is stored on other computers.

- REST provides a definition of a resource.

- We can use the verbs GET, PUT, and DELETE.

- basically, any time we go to a web page, the page GETs all the different information, one piece at a time, and then PUTs it on a viewable page.
