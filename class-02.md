**Text, CSS, Basic JavaScript, and Decisions**

**Text**
  
  - HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (things like headings, paragraphs, subheadings, etc.)

  - They also provide semantic information (such as where emphasis should be placed, definitions of acronyms, quotes, etc.)
  
**Intro to CSS**

  - The key to understanding CSS is to imagine that every HTML element is inside an invisible box.

  - CSS allows you to create rules that control how each box is shown on the webpage.

  - A CSS rule contains two parts: a *selector* and a *declaration*.

    - Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to.

      - You can add multiple elements to a rule by separating them with commas.

    - Declarations are coded inside curly braces and are made up of two parts: a *Property* and a *Value*.

      - Properties are the parts of the element you are changing.

      - Values are the settings for that property.

  - Although you can write CSS directly in an HTML document, it usually appears in a separate document and is linked to the HTML document.

**Basic JavaScript Instructions**

- Scripts are made up of statements, just like steps in a recipe.

- Scripts contain precise instructions.

- Variables are used to temporarily store information used in the script.

- Arrays are special types of variables that store a list of information.

- JavaScript differentiates between numbers (also called integers), strings (text), and Boolean expressions (true and false).

- Expressions use operators (like +, -, /, *, etc.) to evaluate more than one item into a single value.

**Decisions**

- Sometimes you need your code to make a decision about what lines of code should run next.

- There are two parts to a decision: 

  - And expression is evaluated, which returns a value, and
  
  - A conditional statement that says what to do in each situation.

- A comparison operator evaluates a situation by comparing one value to what you expect it to be. The value returned will be a Boolean: true or false (ex: ==, !=, ===, !===, etc.).

- Usually there are two operands and one operator. The operator is placed between the operands, and can be values or variables. Usually these expressions are inside parenthesis (blank + blank1).

- Operands can be expressions, instead of a single variable or value. 
((blank + blank2) > (blank3 * blank4))

- Logical operators compare the results of more than one comparison operator ((blank > blank2) && (blank3 <= blank4))

- If statements check to see if a condition is true. If it is then the code block is executed.

- If...else statements check a condition. If the result is true, the first code block is executed, if it is false, the second code block is executed.
