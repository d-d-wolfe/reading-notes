**HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow**

**Lists**
- HTML provides us with three different types of lists

  - Ordered lists - each list item is numbered

  - Unordered lists - which begin with bullet points

  - Definition lists - which is a set of terms with their definitions
- Lists can be nested inside each other

**Boxes**

- As we already know CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.

- Using CSS we can control the dimensions of each box, as well as the borders, margins, and padding of them.

- It's possible to hide elements using display and visibility properties.

- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and vice versa.

- We can improve the legibility of text by controlling the width of a text box, and the margin.

- We can also create borders around images and rounded borders.

**Loops (and switches)**

- We can compare a value agains possible outcomes using switch statments (and also provide a default option if no others match).

- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.

- All values evaluate to truthy or falsy.

- There are three types of loop: *for*, *while*, and *do...while*. Each one repeats a set of statements.
