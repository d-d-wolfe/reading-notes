**What Google Learned About Teams**

- In 2012, Google became focused on building the perfect team.

- They studied hundreds of Google's teams to figure out why some teams stumbled while others soared.

- No matter how they arranged the data, it was almost impossible to find patterns - or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference.

- Their research identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that somethines the norms of one effective team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group.

- The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the "good" teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.

- As the researchers studied the groups, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared.
  
  - Members spoke in roughly the same proportion (equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking).

  - And, the good teams all had high "average social sensitivity". In other words, they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, expressions and other nonverbal cues.

- Conversational turn-taking and average social sensitivity are aspects of what's known as *psychological safety*.

- Psychological safety is defined as "a sense of confidence that the team will not ebarass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up".

- The behaviors that create psychological safety - conversational turn-taking and empathy - are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to esstablish a bond.

- To be fully present at work, to feel "psychologically safe", we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recrimination.
