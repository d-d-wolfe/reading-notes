## Authentication + Role Based Authorization

- What problems do we need to solve for?

  - What is the user authorized to do?

    - Which parts of our application care about this?

    - How can we determine this?

      - What's in the token?

      - Contact between the UI and the API

  - How do we make this easy to use?

**Proposal**

- `<Auth />` component

  - Based on your permissions and login status, it either gives you access to a componenet or JSX hides it.

  - Must not use Redux

    - Why? We don't want to force implementors into a specific state management system.

```
// The div only shows if you are logged in
  <Auth>
    <div />
  </Auth>

// The div only shows if you are logged in AND have read permissions
  <Auth capability="read">
    <div />
  </Auth>
```
