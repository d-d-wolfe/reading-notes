## Stacks and Queues

**What is a Stack**

  - A stack is a data structure that consists of `Nodes`. Each `Node` references the next Node in the stack, but doesn not reference the previous one.

  - Common terminology for a stack is:

    1. Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are *pushed*.

    2. Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are *popped*. When you attempt to `pop` an empty stack, an exception with be raised.

    3. Top - The top of the stack.

    4. Peek - When you `peek` you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. If you attempt to `peek` an empty stack, an exception will be raised.

    5. IsEmpty - returns true when the stack is empty, otherwise returns false.

  - Stacks follow these concepts:

    - FILO - First In Last Out

    - LIFO - Last In First Out

  - Push O(1)

    - Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes you have in the stack.

    - When adding a Node, you `push` it into the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its `next` property equal to the original `top`.

  - Pop O(1)

    - Popping a Node off the stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a `pop`, the `top` Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the `top` Node is returned to the user.

    - Typically, you would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `pop`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

  - Peek O(1)

    - When conducting a `peek`, you will only be inspecting the `top` Node of the stack.

    - Typically, you would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `peek`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

    - We do not re-assign the `next` property when we `peek` because we want to keep the reference to the next Node in the stack. This will allow the `top` to stay the top until we decide to `pop`.

**What is a Queue**

  - Common terminology for a queue is:

    1. Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.

    2. Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

    3. Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.

    4. Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.

    5. Peek - When you `peek` you will view the value of the `front` Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

    6. IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

  - Queues follow these concepts:

    - FIFO - First In First Out

    - LILO - Last In Last Out

  - Enques O(1)

    - When you add an item to a queue, you use the `enqueue` action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue `(n)`; it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

  - Dequeue O(1)

    - When you remove an item from a queue, you use the `dequeue` action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

    - Typically, you would check `isEmpty` before conducting a `dequeue`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

  - Peek O(1)

    - When conducting a `peek`, you will only be inspecting the `front` Node of the queue.

    - Typically, you want to check `isEmpty` before conducting a `peek`. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.
