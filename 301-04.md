**Responsive Web Design and Regular Expressions**

**RWB with CSS Grid**

- CSS grid is now supported in many modern browsers.

- Similar to the way that flexbos gave us a way to layout block elements next to each other, CSS grid lets us arrange elements in multiple rows or columns.

**Regular Expressions**

- Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e.: a specific sequence of ASCII or unicode characters).

- You can use this for anything from parsing/replacing strings to validation, to passing throughtranslating data to other formats, and web scraping.

- The best thing about regex is that once you've learned the syntax, you can use this tool in (almost) all programming languages.
