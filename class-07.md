**Tables, and Functions and Methods**

**Tables**

- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web page.

- Tables are drawn out row by r w, and these rows are created with the <tr> element.

- Rows are made up of cells, which are represented by the <td> element (or <th> if it's a header).

- You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column by using the *rowspan* or *colspan* attributes.

- If you are creating a very long table, you can split the table int a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.

**Functions and Methods**

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.

- Fucntions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value.

- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.

- JavaScript also has several built-in objects, like *String*, *Number*, *Math*, and *Date*. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
