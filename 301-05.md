**Heroku**

- I installed Heroku during the 301 prework.

- I went through the first part of the tutorial, through the view logs section.

- It appears to me that Heroku is a way to deploy webpages to the web, using Node.js.

- Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, which allows you to build server-side and networking applications.
